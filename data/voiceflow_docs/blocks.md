# Blocks

Group related steps into organized sections.

Blocks are used to group multiple [steps](/docs/steps-1) together on the canvas. They help keep your assistant organized and make it easier to manage complex workflows. Each block has a name and colour, and can contain any number of steps.

Blocks are especially useful when:

* Structuring your conversation into logical sections (e.g. onboarding, booking, support)
* Jumping between parts of the project using [Actions](/docs/actions)
* Reusing flow structures with the [Template library](/docs/templates)

  

## Creating and editing blocks

You can create a block in two ways:

* Drag a step onto an empty area of the canvas - this automatically creates a new block.
* Drag a step into an existing block to add it to that block.

You can rename a block by clicking its label and entering a new name. Use colours to visually group sections of your project.

## Deleting blocks

To delete a block:

* Right-click on the block's background and select **delete**
* Select the block and press `Delete` or `Backspace` on your keyboard.

Deleting a block will also remove all steps inside it, unless you move them out first.

  

## Connecting blocks

You can connect a path to an entire block or to a specific step inside a block.

* If you connect to a block, the conversation will run through all its steps in order.
* If you connect to a step inside a block, the conversation will jump to that specific step and continue from there

To create a connection, click the port (circle) on the right side of a step, then drag the path to your target block or step.
