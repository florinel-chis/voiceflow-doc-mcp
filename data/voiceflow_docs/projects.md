# Interface

Each project is its own AI agent - complete with workflows, logic, and knowledge.

A project in Voiceflow is a standalone AI agent built for a specific task—like customer support, booking, or onboarding. Each project lives inside a [workspace](/docs/workspaces-agents) and includes its own [Workflows](/docs/workflows), [Steps](/docs/steps-1) and [Knowledge base](/docs/knowledge-base).

All the logic, content, and settings for a given agent live inside a single project. When you make changes to a project, they'll be visible to everyone who has access to that project.
