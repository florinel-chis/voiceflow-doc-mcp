# Library

Save and reuse common blocks by saving them to the library.

If you find yourself recreating the same blocks over and over again, you can save time by turning them into templates.

Templates let you reuse sequences of blocks—whether it’s a single block with a few steps, or a full multi-block flow. Once saved to your library, you can drag them onto the canvas like any other step.

  

## Saving a template to the library

You can save any block (or group of blocks) as a template. Here's how:

* Select the blocks you want to save
* Right-click and choose **save to library**
* Give your template a name and choose a colour (optional)

## Using templates saved in your library

Once you've added at least one template to your project's library, you'll see a **Library** option underneath the other steps on the sidebar. When you hover over this option you’ll see a list of saved templates. Just drag one onto the canvas to use it. All blocks and paths inside the template will appear as part of your flow.

## Deleting saved templates

To delete a template saved in your library, right click the template in the library and select **delete**.
