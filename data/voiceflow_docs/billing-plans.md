# Billing

Voiceflow offers a flexible and transparent billing system designed to accommodate teams of all sizes.

There are three aspects to Voiceflow's billing system that you should be aware of:

* **Plans:** these are billed as a monthly or annual subscription per workspace, and control which Voiceflow features you have access to.
* **Editor Seats:** all plans include one editor seat. Additional editor seats can be added onto any paid plan.
* **Credits:** these are how you're billed for usage on Voiceflow. Each plan includes a specified amount of credits. You cannot buy additional credits outside of upgrading your plan.

## Plans

Voiceflow offers four plans designed to fit any size of business. Each plan is billed at the workspace level, meaning you can build and launch multiple AI agents using a single plan.

* The **Starter** plan is designed for users to try out building with Voiceflow. It isn't designed for production usage, and has a hard credit limit.
* The **Pro** and **Business** plans start at $60 per month and are designed for agencies and growing businesses to build on Voiceflow. Many companies run production workloads on these plans.
* The **Enterprise** plan is designed for larger businesses that are running very large workloads or would prefer to pay by invoice. Features such as single-sign-on, private cloud, and custom limits are only available in the Enterprise plan.

## Editor seats

All Voiceflow plans include one editor seat, meaning one person can edit all of the agents inside a workspace. If you'd like to work with a team, you can add additional editor seats to your workspace at a fixed price of $50 per editor on the Pro and Business plans. A single editor seat provides access to all agents in a workspace, although you can choose to restrict editors to specific project if you'd prefer.

## Credits

Credits are the currency that Voiceflow uses to bill for usage. Each plan includes a specific number of credits. Credit charges are incurred when your agent does actions such as sending a message, calling a phone number, or generating text using AI. [You can learn more about credits here](/docs/credits).
