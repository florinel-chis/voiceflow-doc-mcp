## What data does the dashboard include?

The dashboard now offers a comprehensive set of visualizations, providing deeper insights into your agent's performance:

* **Credits Usage**: Monitor AI credit consumption over time across all models, giving you a clear picture of your assistant's resource utilization.
* **Total Interactions**: Keep track of the total number of interactions (requests) between users and your assistant over time, providing insights into engagement levels.
* **Latency Monitoring**: Measure the average response time of your assistant to ensure optimal performance and identify any potential bottlenecks.
* **Total Call Minutes**: Gain visibility into the cumulative duration of voice calls in minutes, helping you understand the volume and significance of voice interactions.
* **Unique Users**: Identify the count of distinct users interacting with your assistant over time, allowing you to track adoption and growth.
* **KB Documents Usage**: Analyze the frequency of knowledge base document access, with the ability to toggle between ascending and descending order to identify the most or least used documents.
* **Intents Usage**: Visualize the distribution of triggered intents, with sorting options to analyze intent frequency and identify popular or underutilized intents.
* **Functions Usage**: Monitor the frequency of function calls, with sorting capabilities to identify the most or least used functions and optimize your assistant's functionality.
* **Prompts Usage**: Gain insights into the usage frequency of assistant prompts, with the ability to toggle between ascending and descending order to analyze prompt utilization and effectiveness.
