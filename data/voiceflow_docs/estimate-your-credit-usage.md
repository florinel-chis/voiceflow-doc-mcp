# Estimate your credit usage

Voiceflow's [credit system](/docs/credits) is designed to make costs transparent and easy to understand. Credits are shared between all agents in a workspace, and each plan includes a specific number of credits. You can learn more about Voiceflow's plans on our [pricing page](https://voiceflow.com/pricing).

If you're not sure which plan to choose, or want to estimate how many credits your agents will consume, we've built a calculator to help. Please note that all numbers shown are estimates and may vary based on your use-case.
