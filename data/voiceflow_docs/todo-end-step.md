# End step

Finish your agent's conversation with a user.

The End step allows your agent to cleanly finish a conversation. In the real world, this might mean hanging up the phone when using Voiceflow's [voice (phone number)](/docs/telephony) integration, or closing a chat session when using our [web chat widget](/docs/chat-widget)/

Use the End step when the conversation has reached a natural conclusion, like after confirming an appointment, submitting a form, or answering a user's final question. It helps signal to both the user and the system that no further interaction is expected.

  

## Basic usage

To use the End step, drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the point where you want the conversation to stop. The End step does not have any settings.

Please note that any steps placed after the End step will not be executed or shown to the user.
