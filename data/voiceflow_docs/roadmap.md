# Roadmap

`voiceflow-cli` is in active development. The core product is functioning.

Our goal with the tool is to prove that there's market fit for a solution like this, and if so, we'll invest more time in automation, user experience, more features.

For now, if you're interested in participating and giving feedback, we believe `voiceflow-cli` already solves pain at this stage.

Shipped:

* Available in homebrew, scoop, choco, winget package managers
* Documentation updated
* Test execution
* Container image available for multiple architectures
* SBOM files created
* Artifacts uploaded, signed and available on GitHub

Coming soon:

* Continuous integration support (GitHub Action, CircleCI, etc.)
* Add more Voiceflow APIs
