# Documentation Copilot

## Overview

To show off how powerful custom interfaces and deeply embedded AI can be for immersive experiences, we built **EduChat**, an article reading app with an AI copilot, to make the educational experience more engaging. It lets readers ask questions about the article they're currently reading. The AI copilot has context of the article being read, and can access a [knowledge base](/docs/knowledge-base) of extra information to supplement its answers with expert knowledge. The AI also proactively generates conversation starters to increase engagement.

This app is built as a Voiceflow custom interface, built in React. Building in React is great because it lets use fully customize how our chat interface works, and can pass extra data back to our Voiceflow agent like the article currently being read, or other metrics.

## Instructions, Code, and Videos

The code and instructions for this project can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/SuperZooper3/Voiceflow-EduChat).

Here's a demo video showing the custom interface in action, and discussing it.
