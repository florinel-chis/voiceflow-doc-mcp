## Overview

The Statistics dashboard provides comprehensive analytics and insights into your test execution performance, trends, and patterns. Monitor the health and reliability of your Voiceflow applications through detailed metrics and visualizations.

## Dashboard Overview

### Key Metrics

The statistics dashboard displays:

* **Total Executions**: Overall count of test executions
* **Success Rate**: Percentage of tests that completed successfully
* **Average Execution Time**: Mean duration of test runs
* **Recent Activity**: Latest test execution results and trends

## Filtering and Time Periods

### Time Range Filters

View statistics for different periods:

* **Today**: Current day's test activity
* **Last 7 Days**: Weekly performance overview
* **Last 30 Days**: Monthly trends and patterns
* **Last 90 Days**: Quarterly analysis
* **Custom Range**: Select specific date ranges

### Test Suite Filters

* **All Suites**: Combined statistics across all test suites
* **Individual Suites**: Focus on specific test suite performance

### Execution Type Filters

* **All Executions**: Combined view of manual and scheduled tests
* **Manual Only**: Focus on user-initiated test runs
* **Scheduled Only**: Analyze automated test performance
* **Trigger Comparison**: Compare manual vs. scheduled success rates

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Success Metrics

* **Overall Success Rate**: Percentage of successful test executions
* **Success by Test Suite**: Individual suite performance rates
* **Success Trends**: How success rates change over time
* **Failure Analysis**: Common failure patterns and causes

### Performance Metrics

* **Execution Duration**: Average and median test execution times
* **Performance Trends**: How execution speed changes over time
* **Suite Performance**: Individual test suite execution times
* **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow or inefficient tests

### Activity Metrics

* **Execution Frequency**: How often tests are run
* **Peak Usage Times**: When tests are most frequently executed
* **User Activity**: Test execution patterns by user
* **Scheduling Effectiveness**: Scheduled vs. manual execution rates

## Export and Sharing

Data can be exported as a **CSV Export** so you can download statistics for external analysis
