# Knowledge base

## What is this?

The Knowledge Base is a repository and management system for content that your AI Agent uses to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. It allows you to:

1. Store and organize information your agent can reference
2. Provide context for more accurate and relevant responses
3. Easily update and maintain your agent's knowledge

## Reference

The `voiceflow-cli` has a command that allows you to interact with your Voiceflow Knowledge bases from your terminal or from your CI pipelines.

To know more, you can run the `voiceflow kb` command. For the usage, please refer to this [page](/cmd/voiceflow_kb).
