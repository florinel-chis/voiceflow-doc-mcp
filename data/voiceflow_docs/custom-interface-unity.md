# Unity AI Powered NPC

## Overview

Voiceflow Agents can be used to power NPCs in video games, so using Voiceflow's flexible APIs, we built an AI powered NPC proof of concept to show off what's possible.

This custom interface is especially powerful because we're going above just having a LLM hooked up to the mount of an NPC, but we've actually hand-crafted their interaction model so that they go down certain predictable flows, and can **interact with the world** through custom actions. The NPC can climb to chance the scene, can give or receive items, has a spoken voice using ElevenLabs from inside Voiceflow, and even has AI powered faces to show emotion.

## Instructions, Code, and Videos

The code and instructions for this project can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/SuperZooper3/Voiceflow-GameFlow/tree/main).

Here's a demo video showing the custom interface in action, and discussing it.

And here's a detailed walkthrough of the development of the project.
